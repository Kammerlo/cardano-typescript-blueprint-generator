# Repo under heavy development, please check back later.

This repo will contain a typescript blueprint generator for [MeshJS](https://meshjs.dev/).

### Desired outcomes

- Automated generation of converter functions from the generated interfaces to MeshJS Data Object

### Todos
- [ ] Implement all types described in CIP-57
- [ ] Implement cli to generate the code
- [ ] Spike options about tsc integration or how to run it in a more embedded way
- [ ] Implement tests
- [ ] Implement auto generated documentation for the generated code
- [ ] Add general documentation about the project
- [ ] Add compiled code to the generated files + script address
